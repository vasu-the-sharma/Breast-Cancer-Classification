# Breast-Cancer-Classification

We can download the dataset from sklearn.datasets and import 'load_breast_cancer' dataset.

We import Confusionn Matrix from sklearn.metrics and use it to calculate the number of accurate and inaccurate predictions.

Out of the 188 predictions my model made, only 8 were inaccurate and 180 were accurate predictions.

We import classification_report from sklearn.metrics and calculate the avergae accuracy of our model.

The accuracy comes out to be 95+ %
